  "description": "The idea involves solving the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation using an explicit Euler time integrator implemented in PyTorch. The solver operates on a periodic domain and processes batches of initial states on a grid. Convective flux is calculated and its spatial derivative is evaluated using a finite-difference stencil. The diffusion term is obtained via a three-point Laplacian. The time-stepping is adaptive with a ceiling set by stability criteria, and computations are optimized for GPU execution. The method outputs a tensor recording the initial and subsequent states of the system.",
