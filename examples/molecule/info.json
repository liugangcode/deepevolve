    "description": "This task focuses on general molecular property prediction, with Side Effect Resource (SIDER) used as a proxy dataset for algorithm development. The primary goal is to design algorithms that generalize across molecular property prediction tasks. The dataset is scaffold-split to assess generalization to novel chemical structures",
