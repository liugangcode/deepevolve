  "description": "The approach uses a U-Net architecture for segmenting nuclei in microscopy images. Key steps include resizing images to 256x256 pixels, normalizing them, and converting masks to unique integers using connected-component analysis. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer for a maximum of 100 epochs with the soft Dice loss function. Early stopping is employed based on the validation Dice coefficient. During inference, the model outputs probability maps which are thresholded and processed to extract individual nuclei as connected components.",
  "motivation": "The motivation is to accurately identify and segment nuclei in microscopy images, which can be crucial for biological research, diagnostics, and treatment planning.",
  "implementation_notes": "Utilizes common preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization) followed by U-Net training. Employs connected-component analysis for mask conversion.",
