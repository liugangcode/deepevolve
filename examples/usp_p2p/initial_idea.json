  "description": "The idea involves fine-tuning the BERT model specifically trained for patent data (BERT for Patents) on the USP-P2P dataset. This process involves using a single-label regression head for the task. The dataset examples are tokenized by concatenating anchor, target, and context elements using `[SEP]` as a separator. The model is trained for one epoch using a batch size of 160 and a learning rate of 2e-5. No checkpointing or logging is applied during training. Evaluation on the test set is performed by calculating the Pearson correlation between the model's predicted scores and the actual scores.",
  "motivation": "The motivation is to leverage a pretrained BERT model tailored for patents to enhance performance on a specific patent paragraph-to-paragraph (USP-P2P) similarity task, potentially improving the accuracy and efficiency of patent-related text processing.",
  "implementation_notes": "1. Use the 'anferico/bert-for-patents' as the base model.\n2. Add a regression head to the model output.\n3. Tokenize input by concatenating anchor, target, and context text with `[SEP]`.\n4. Set training parameters: batch size = 160, learning rate = 2e-5.\n5. Limit fine-tuning to one epoch, ignoring checkpointing and logging.\n6. Evaluate using Pearson correlation between predictions and true scores.",
  "pseudocode": "1. Load pre-trained `anferico/bert-for-patents` model with regression head.\n2. Prepare input data by joining anchor, target, and context with `[SEP]`.\n3. Fine-tune model for 1 epoch:\n   - Set batch size = 160\n   - Set learning rate = 2e-5\n4. Calculate Pearson correlation on test set predictions.",
