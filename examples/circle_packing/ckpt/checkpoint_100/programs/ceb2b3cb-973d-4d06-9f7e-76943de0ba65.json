  "report": "This report synthesizes insights from our enhanced Delaunay/AWVD filtered SCP framework and complementary approaches in recent literature. From our starting idea, we appreciate the efficiency of Delaunay triangulation and AWVD filtering to identify neighboring pairs, and the effectiveness of adaptive damping in stabilizing the sequential convex programming (SCP) updates for positions and radii. Moreover, the block\u2010coordinate descent approach offers a robust separation between position and radius optimization while ensuring exact feasibility via Shapely-based geometric projections and carefully tuned numerical tolerances.\n\nRelated works underscore the value of symmetry reduction, rigorous interval branch-and-bound verification, and adaptive backtracking methods (e.g. using the Armijo rule) to manage floating-point precision and enforce stringent non-overlap conditions. These insights motivate a research direction that integrates high-precision parameter settings, explicit convergence thresholds (such as minimum center displacement and gap tolerance on the order of 1e-8), and verified geometric corrections via interval arithmetic.\n\nWe propose a refined algorithm that leverages a multi\u2010start initialization (employing grid/Apollonian seeding enhanced with symmetry filtering) followed by an iterative SCP scheme. At each iteration, positions are updated via SLSQP with fixed radii using rigorously set tolerances, and candidate overlapping pairs are isolated using Delaunay/AWVD filtering. For each pair, adaptive damping projections are enforced via Shapely\u2014with backtracking line search implementing Armijo\u2019s condition\u2014to guarantee sufficient descent. Persistent overlaps trigger a branch-and-bound verification step using interval arithmetic (integrated with libraries such as intvalpy, python-intervals, or mpmath) to rigorously certify non-overlap and boundary precision. Radii are then updated with strict handling of boundary constraints. This integrated approach balances local accuracy with global assurance and is reproducible through clearly defined numerical parameters and termination criteria.",
