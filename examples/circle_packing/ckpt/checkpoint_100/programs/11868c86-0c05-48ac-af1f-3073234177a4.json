  "report": "In addressing the challenging problem of maximizing the sum of circle radii for 26\u201332 circles within a unit square, we synthesize several key insights. First, the starting approach\u2014Enhanced Delaunay/AWVD Filtered SCP with Adaptive Damping\u2014demonstrates that filtering neighbor candidates via Delaunay triangulation and using adaptive damping in sequential convex programming (SCP) significantly improve convergence while managing non\u2010overlap constraints. Second, related works highlight that incorporating rigorous feasibility checks through interval arithmetic and local branch\u2010and\u2010bound corrections provides a reliable mechanism to certify that all geometric constraints are exactly satisfied. Third, enforcing geometric symmetries, particularly D4 symmetry (rotations by 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and reflections across the axes and diagonals), effectively prunes redundant configurations and reduces the search space. Fourth, adaptive projection methods inspired by Douglas\u2013Rachford or Dykstra algorithms reliably correct overlaps when traditional gradient steps prove insufficient. Recent evidence also suggests that fixed-position strategies and ordering constraints (to impose symmetry breaking) can significantly streamline computations. Additionally, integrating libraries for rigorous interval arithmetic (such as intvalpy, pyinterval, or python-intervals) with Shapely enables precise geometric validations for both non-overlap and boundary adherence.\n\nFrom these insights, we propose grouping future research into three directions: (1) Enhanced local optimization with adaptive damping and projection corrections; (2) Dual-level verification by coupling efficient Delaunay filtering with interval-based certification and branch-and-bound corrections; (3) Exploiting explicit D4 symmetry constraints to reduce redundancy and complexity. Our conceptual framework is organized into a modular pipeline starting with robust initialization (using grid and Apollonian seeding), followed by alternating block-coordinate descent (optimizing positions and radii), integrated adaptive projection corrections, explicit symmetry enforcement, and a final certification layer.\n\nAmong several ideas, the chosen approach is a Symmetry-Enhanced Dual Verification Block-Coordinate Descent. This method maintains the essence of the current SCP-based strategy but augments it with a dual verification layer\u2014using Delaunay filtering for rapid local detection and interval arithmetic-based global checks\u2014and incorporates explicit D4 symmetry constraints through fixed positions and ordering measures to eliminate redundant configurations. This layered verification addresses potential overfitting or shortcut learning by ensuring that every iteration is rigorously validated before further optimization steps.\n\nBelow is an outline of the proposed pseudocode and algorithm modules, which leverage NumPy, SciPy, and Shapely without resorting to neural network models.",
