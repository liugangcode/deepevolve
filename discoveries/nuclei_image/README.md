### Synthesis of Insights and Proposed Directions

Our starting pipeline leverages dynamic early exits and offline self-distillation to reduce computation in high-confidence regions while focusing refinement on ambiguous areas with a lightweight PointRend module. Key insights include: (1) Dynamic early-exit reduces redundant computation in high-confidence regions; (2) Temperature-scaled uncertainty calibration effectively identifies ambiguous regions for focused refinement; (3) Offline self-distillation, when using teacher-student networks with shared architectures and losses (e.g., cross-entropy, Dice, and KL divergence), improves segmentation without incurring shortcut learning; (4) Lightweight refinement modules using differentiable morphological operations can substitute heavy modules while providing robust boundary preservation.

Related works contribute additional insights: (A) Synthetic data augmentation via GANs and CycleGAN improves model generalization; (B) Hardware-aware NAS and INT8 post-training quantization (PTQ) workflows enable efficient model deployment on GPUs (using representative calibration datasets and techniques like MSE or entropy-based scaling); (C) Graph-based and morphological refinement approaches capture complex boundary details; (D) Dynamic resolution adaptation further reduces computational load while preserving accuracy.

These insights group naturally into three directions: 1) Adaptive Inference and Uncertainty Calibration; 2) Efficient Boundary Refinement via Morphological Operations; and 3) Hardware-Aware Optimization including PTQ and distillation strategies. A conceptual framework emerges by mapping these directions on a grid with one axis for dynamic inference (early-exit strategies, offline self-distillation, LTS) and another for efficient region refinement (morphological operations, graph-based methods), while augmentation, NAS, and PTQ serve as complementary modules.

Given our research progress (40%) and the goal of balancing performance improvement with implementable efficiency, we select the **Adaptive Morphological Refinement Enhanced U-Net** as the top idea.

### Detailed Description of the Chosen Idea
**Adaptive Morphological Refinement Enhanced U-Net** replaces the computationally intensive PointRend module with GPU-optimized, differentiable morphological operations, leveraging Kornia to perform erosion and dilation for boundary refinement. The network first processes the input image using a U-Net enhanced with offline self-distillation—where the teacher and student share architectures and employ KL divergence, cross-entropy, and Dice losses—to obtain a robust probability map. Local Temperature Scaling (LTS) then produces a per-pixel uncertainty map that highlights ambiguous regions while mitigating shortcut learning. Ambiguous regions are refined using tailored morphological operations with well-chosen structuring elements (e.g., circular or cross-shaped, with sizes and iterations set based on nuclei dimensions). Finally, to meet strict runtime requirements on the A6k GPU, post-training INT8 quantization is applied following a calibrated PTQ workflow. This involves using a representative dataset (e.g., at least 80 images with a batch size of 8) and methods (MSE or entropy-based calibration) as recommended by NVIDIA’s TAO Toolkit documentation.

*Pseudocode Overview:*

    function segment_nuclei(image):
        preprocessed = preprocess(image)
        // Offline self-distillation: teacher and student share U-Net architecture
        prob_map = U_Net_with_selfdistillation(preprocessed)
        // Calibrate uncertainties using Local Temperature Scaling (LTS)
        uncertainty_map = local_temperature_scaling(prob_map)
        low_confidence_regions = identify_regions(uncertainty_map, threshold)
        // Refine boundaries using Kornia's erosion/dilation with tuned SE parameters
        refined_regions = kornia_morphological_refinement(low_confidence_regions, se_shape, se_size, iterations)
        merged_mask = merge(prob_map, refined_regions)
        // Apply PTQ-based INT8 quantization with proper calibration datasets
        final_mask = quantize(postprocess(merged_mask), calibration_data)
        return final_mask

This approach clearly details each step—from uncertainty estimation and morphological refinement to INT8 quantization—and includes references to calibration workflows ([docs.nvidia.com](https://docs.nvidia.com/tao/tao-toolkit-archive/tao-40-1/text/semantic_segmentation/unet.html)) and LTS ([github.com/uncbiag/LTS](https://github.com/uncbiag/LTS)). The modular design minimizes overfitting risks by leveraging established offline self-distillation protocols and carefully tuned morphological operations. All implementation steps are described with sufficient clarity to enable reproduction and further optimization under constrained GPU runtime requirements.

# Motivation

To significantly improve nuclei segmentation performance under strict runtime constraints on NVIDIA A6k GPUs, we propose replacing the heavy PointRend module with an efficient, GPU-optimized scheme based on differentiable morphological operations using Kornia. By integrating offline self-distillation (using teacher-student models with KL divergence and combined loss functions) and Local Temperature Scaling for uncertainty estimation, the model selectively refines ambiguous regions. Subsequent application of INT8 post-training quantization using calibrated PTQ workflows ensures accelerated inference while preserving segmentation accuracy.

# Implementation Notes

1. Preprocess input images and generate a coarse segmentation probability map using a U-Net enhanced with offline self-distillation (teacher and student with matching architectures, loss functions including cross-entropy, Dice, and KL divergence). 2. Apply Local Temperature Scaling (LTS) to calibrate per-pixel uncertainty and produce an uncertainty map. 3. Identify low-confidence regions using a tuned threshold. 4. Use Kornia’s morphological operations (erosion and dilation) with carefully selected structuring element (shape and size based on nuclei morphology) and controlled iteration counts to refine boundaries. 5. Merge refined outputs with high-confidence regions. 6. Employ INT8 post-training quantization following a calibration procedure using a representative calibration dataset (minimum 80 images, batch size 8, using MSE or entropy methods for scaling factor determination) as outlined in NVIDIA TAO Toolkit guidelines. 7. Ensure robust data augmentation and proper hyperparameter tuning to mitigate overfitting and shortcut learning.

# Evolution History

**Version 1:** Enhance the nuclei detection pipeline by integrating an optimized PointRend module into the baseline U-Net. The module selectively refines the probability maps in regions with ambiguous boundaries, with systematic hyperparameter tuning to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.

**Version 2:** Integrate a calibrated uncertainty estimation module into a baseline U-Net with an optimized PointRend module. The design refines only low-confidence regions by calibrating uncertainty scores (using methods such as grid search with Platt Scaling), thus balancing segmentation accuracy against computational cost while mitigating shortcut learning.

**Version 3:** Dynamic Selective Refinement with Uncertainty-aware Early-Exit, Boundary Preservation and Quantization (DSEQ-BP) integrates a rep-parameterized U-Net backbone with temperature-scaled uncertainty estimation, leveraging early-exit to bypass high-confidence regions and applying a specialized PointRend module with optional Boundary Patch Refinement for ambiguous, boundary-rich areas. The pipeline is further accelerated by post-training quantization to adhere to stringent runtime budgets on an A6k GPU.

**Version 4:** Dynamic Early-Exit U-Net with Offline Self-Distillation leverages temperature-scaled uncertainty estimation to trigger early exits in high-confidence regions and applies a lightweight PointRend refinement on ambiguous areas. Offline self-distillation is performed during training using a teacher network, which is removed at inference to maintain efficiency. The final segmentation output is post-processed and quantized to comply with runtime constraints on an A6k GPU.
