## Overview

Periodic Edge Enhanced DBRIGNN-ML (PE-DBRIGNN-ML) integrates a periodic edge generation module into the DBRIGNN-ML architecture. It enhances polymer property prediction by explicitly connecting polymerization markers ('*') with chemically accurate bond features, thereby enforcing chain periodicity and improving the inductive bias related to repeating monomer structures. An optional integration with BigSMILES representations and a dynamic meta-learning pooling module further augment the model.

### Synthesis and Proposed Directions

Our starting point, DBRIGNN-ML, leverages dual message passing streams and a meta-learning guided adaptive pooling module that uses a normalized repetition invariant feature (derived from polymerization markers '*') to capture the periodicity of polymer chains. This design provides a robust inductive bias but can be further enhanced by explicitly connecting polymerization markers to enforce chain periodicity and by assigning chemically accurate bond features (e.g., bond type, aromaticity) to these periodic edges. In addition, recent meta-learning frameworks such as Policy-GNN and G-Meta demonstrate dynamic, property-specific pooling strategies that can be integrated to further reduce weighted MAE and shortcut learning. Insights from related works emphasize the importance of: (1) explicit periodic edge augmentation to simulate continuous chain connectivity while avoiding unintended cycles; (2) integration of meta-learning for dynamic pooling with accurate bond feature assignment; and (3) leveraging BigSMILES representations as an optional extension for improved polymer encoding.

### Structured Framework

- **Input Representation:** Convert polymer SMILES into graph representations while flagging '*' tokens. Optionally, use BigSMILES for a more compact stochastic representation.
- **Edge Construction:** Build two kinds of edges—standard chemical bonds and polymer-specific edges—with chemically accurate features (bond type, aromaticity, and bond length). Introduce a periodic edge module that connects terminal '*' nodes to mimic chain continuity without creating unintended cycles.
- **Message Passing:** Apply dual message passing with separate aggregation for both edge types. Fuse messages via an attention mechanism modulated by the invariant feature (normalized '*' frequency) and dynamically adjust pooling operations based on meta-learning insights from frameworks like Policy-GNN.
- **Adaptive Pooling & Regression:** Use property-sensitive adaptive pooling (sum for extensive properties, mean/attention for intensive ones) guided by a meta-learning module before the regression head, with additional physics-informed loss terms as needed to mitigate overfitting and shortcut learning.

### Detailed Description of the Chosen Idea

**Periodic Edge Enhanced DBRIGNN-ML (PE-DBRIGNN-ML):**
This approach augments the existing DBRIGNN-ML by explicitly constructing periodic edges with chemically accurate bond features. When parsing the SMILES, polymerization markers ('*') are flagged to generate two sets of edges: standard bonds and polymer-specific edges. A dedicated module then connects terminal '*' tokens—ensuring that bonds are assigned features (e.g., bond type, aromaticity, conjugation) based on RDKit computations—to explicitly model chain periodicity. The invariant feature, computed as the ratio of '*' tokens to total nodes, modulates the attention fusion of messages from the dual message passing streams. Furthermore, meta-learning inspired dynamic pooling (in line with Policy-GNN and G-Meta strategies) adapts pooling operations depending on property-specific needs. Property-sensitive adaptive pooling is applied prior to regression. Dropout, residual connections, and auxiliary physics-informed losses further safeguard against overfitting and shortcut learning.

**Pseudocode Outline:**

for each polymer in dataset:
  • graph = parse_SMILES(polymer.SMILES)  // Preserve '*' tokens using RDKit sanitization with custom settings
  • polymer_edges = extract_edges(graph, marker='*')
  • periodic_edges = connect_terminal_markers(graph, polymer_edges)  // Assign bond features (type, aromaticity, etc.)
  • invariant_feature = count('*') / total_nodes(graph)
  • for each message passing layer:
      - msg_standard = aggregate(graph.standard_edges)
      - msg_polymer = aggregate(graph.polymer_edges + periodic_edges)
      - fused_msg = attention_fuse([msg_standard, msg_polymer], invariant_feature)
      - update_node_embeddings(fused_msg)
  • pooled_feature = adaptive_pool(graph.nodes, property_type)  // Dynamic pooling guided by meta-learning
  • prediction = regression(pooled_feature)
  • loss = weighted_MAE_loss(prediction, ground_truth) + auxiliary_physics_loss
  • update_model(loss)

This design explicitly incorporates polymerization inductive bias, precise periodic edge construction, and dynamic pooling adaptability to improve polymer property prediction metrics.

# Motivation

Polymer properties are significantly influenced by chain repeat structures and chemically accurate bond interactions. By generating periodic edges that simulate continuous chain connectivity and assigning detailed bond attributes, the model can better capture structural nuances. Integrating dynamic pooling inspired by meta-learning frameworks (Policy-GNN, G-Meta) further tailors the aggregation process to property-specific needs, reducing overfitting and shortcut learning while enhancing weighted MAE and R² performance.

# Implementation Notes

1. Parse polymer SMILES with RDKit, ensuring '*' tokens are preserved; optionally convert BigSMILES representations for enhanced structure capture.
2. Construct two edge types: standard chemical bonds and polymer-specific edges. For periodic edges, connect terminal '*' nodes and use RDKit to assign bond features (one-hot encoding for bond type, aromaticity, conjugation, etc.), ensuring the graph accurately reflects polymer periodicity and avoids unintended cycles.
3. Compute a normalized invariant feature as the ratio of '*' count to total nodes.
4. Within each message passing layer, perform separate aggregations for standard and polymer edges, and fuse them using an attention mechanism modulated by the invariant feature.
5. Employ dynamic, property-sensitive adaptive pooling guided by a meta-learning strategy (inspired by Policy-GNN and G-Meta) to select appropriate pooling operations (sum for extensive, mean/attention for intensive properties).
6. Integrate dropout, residual connections, and auxiliary physics-informed losses (e.g., enforcing known scaling laws) to mitigate overfitting and shortcut learning.
7. Validate bond feature assignment against standard chemical descriptors to ensure reproducibility.

# Evolution History

**Version 1:** Enhanced Polymer Inductive Graph Neural Network (EPIGNN) using dual-stage message passing that distinguishes standard bonds, polymer-specific edges, and periodic connections, combined with adaptive pooling based on property type, to predict polymer properties.

**Version 2:** ERPIGNN-RI enhances the EPIGNN approach by integrating a repetition invariant feature that quantifies the normalized frequency of polymerization markers ('*'). This feature modulates an attention-fused dual-stage message passing framework, allowing the model to distinguish between standard chemical bonds and polymer-specific edges while accounting for periodic chain architecture. Optional extensions include the integration of 3D conformer features and E(3)-equivariant descriptors to capture spatial structure, provided that computational resources allow.

**Version 3:** Hierarchical Repetition Extraction with Adaptive Pooling (RHEGA-P) segments polymer graphs into explicit repeat units using polymerization markers. It performs localized message passing within each unit and aggregates the resulting embeddings with property-sensitive adaptive pooling, while integrating a DP-aware physics-informed auxiliary loss.

**Version 4:** The Dual Branch Repetition-Invariant GNN (DBRIGNN) explicitly segregates message passing for standard chemical bonds and polymer-specific bonds marked by '*'. Its core innovation is the use of a normalized repetition invariant feature to guide an attention-based fusion of dual streams, followed by property-specific adaptive pooling and a regression head to predict five key polymer properties. The design is structured to be extendable with dynamic features or self-supervised contrastive pretraining for improved invariance.

**Version 5:** DBRIGNN-ML enhances the existing Dual Branch Repetition-Invariant GNN by integrating a meta-learning module for per-property adaptive pooling and attention fusion. The model dynamically adjusts its pooling strategies using a compact meta-network and incorporates overfitting safeguards such as gradient dropout and meta-gradient augmentation. An optional extension permits the use of BigSMILES representations for a more accurate capture of polymer repeat structures.

**Version 6:** Periodic Edge Enhanced DBRIGNN-ML (PE-DBRIGNN-ML) integrates a periodic edge generation module into the DBRIGNN-ML architecture. It enhances polymer property prediction by explicitly connecting polymerization markers ('*') with chemically accurate bond features, thereby enforcing chain periodicity and improving the inductive bias related to repeating monomer structures. An optional integration with BigSMILES representations and a dynamic meta-learning pooling module further augment the model.
