## Overview

Dual-Loss with Contrastive Regularization for Fine-Tuning Patent BERT: Integrate normalized CPC embeddings via element-wise fusion with token embeddings, employ LoRA adapters (rank = 8, α = 16, dropout = 0.1), and use a dual loss framework combining Smooth K2 Loss (with α = 4, β = 0.25) for ordinal regression with NT-Xent contrastive loss for semantic discrimination.

# Deep Research Report

### Synthesis of Insights

From the starting research idea, we note that (1) integrating normalized, learnable CPC embeddings can more effectively capture domain-specific context to disambiguate technical terms, (2) the use of parameter-efficient LoRA adapters reduces computational overhead while allowing model specialization, (3) the application of an ordinal regression head with Smooth K2 Loss respects the ordered nature of similarity scores, (4) incorporating a contrastive regularization branch (e.g., NT-Xent) can enhance discriminative power by enforcing inter-sample relationships, and (5) careful tuning of LoRA hyperparameters (rank = 8, alpha = 16, dropout = 0.1) and loss parameters (Smooth K2 Loss's α and β) is critical to avoid overfitting and maintain training efficiency under strict runtime constraints.

Related works further underscore the promise of contrastive and retrieval-augmented learning (e.g., PatentSBERTa and PAI-NET), the benefit of efficient LoRA tuning strategies, and the potential of advanced fusion techniques (e.g., gating or attention-based fusion) to integrate CPC metadata. These insights align with the need to enhance semantic similarity predictions in a resource-constrained patent domain by carefully balancing performance and efficiency.

### Organized Research Directions

1. **Domain-Aware Fusion:** Integrate and normalize CPC embeddings with token embeddings using efficient fusion methods such as element-wise addition, with the possibility to explore gating or attention mechanisms in future iterations.
2. **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Employ LoRA adapters with carefully chosen hyperparameters (rank = 8, α = 16, dropout = 0.1) and dynamic learning rate schedules to meet the 30-minute, three-epoch runtime constraint.
3. **Advanced Loss Optimization:** Combine ordinal regression (using Smooth K2 Loss with tunable α and β) with NT-Xent contrastive loss to capture both ordered similarity scores and fine-grained semantic differences, while mitigating overfitting and shortcut learning through appropriate regularization techniques.

### Conceptual Framework

A taxonomy of methods can be arranged along two axes: on one side, embedding fusion strategies (ranging from simple element-wise addition to more complex gating or attention-based methods) and on the other, loss optimization strategies (from basic regression losses to composite dual-loss systems). This framework highlights opportunities to integrate robust domain information without compromising model efficiency.

### Selected Idea: Dual-Loss with Contrastive Regularization

This idea presents a balanced mix of innovation and feasibility. It combines an ordinal regression head (with Smooth K2 Loss) for ordered similarity prediction and a supervised NT-Xent contrastive loss on intermediate representations. Appropriate LoRA hyperparameters (rank = 8, α = 16, dropout = 0.1) ensure a small number of trainable parameters, reduced VRAM usage, and quick convergence, thus satisfying the 30-minute, three-epoch constraint. Element-wise addition is employed for fusing CPC and token embeddings, although future work could explore gating mechanisms for dynamic weighting. Regularization through dropout and gradient clipping mitigates overfitting and shortcut learning. The approach thus strikes a practical balance between immediate performance improvements and long-term extensibility.

**Key Steps & Pseudocode:**

1. Tokenize input by concatenating anchor, target, and CPC context using a [SEP] token.
2. Compute normalized CPC embeddings via a learnable embedding layer; apply a linear projection to align them with BERT token dimensions.
3. Fuse these embeddings with token embeddings using element-wise addition.
4. Process the fused inputs through Patent BERT enhanced with LoRA adapters configured with rank = 8, α = 16, and dropout = 0.1.
5. Use an ordinal regression head to obtain similarity scores and compute Smooth K2 Loss (with tunable hyperparameters, e.g., α = 4, β = 0.25).
6. Extract intermediate representations for both anchor and target tokens, and compute the NT-Xent contrastive loss at temperature τ = 0.1, leveraging in-batch negative sampling.
7. Combine the losses as: Total Loss = Smooth K2 Loss + λ * Contrastive Loss (with λ chosen between 0.3 and 0.5).
8. Backpropagate using gradient clipping and update weights with a cosine learning rate scheduler under mixed precision training.

This method is designed to be implemented efficiently while ensuring robust semantic similarity performance and mitigating risks of overfitting through careful hyperparameter tuning.
