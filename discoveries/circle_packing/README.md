## Overview

Hybrid Weighted Delaunay Enhanced Adaptive Multi-Start SLSQP with Interval Verification for exact circle packings.

# Deep Research Report

This report proposes an enhanced algorithm for packing 26–32 circles in a unit square by precisely maximizing the sum of their radii while ensuring exact validity. Our insights from the starting point highlight that (1) the use of power diagrams paired with SLSQP refinement provides rapid local convergence, (2) adaptive perturbations can correct subtle infeasibilities, (3) robust geometric processing using Shapely ensures candidates are confined correctly, and (4) low-discrepancy (Sobol) initialization increases diversity in candidate configurations. Complementarily, related works emphasize that (1) weighted Delaunay triangulation improves candidate seeding, (2) interval arithmetic and branch-and-bound methods can rigorously certify feasibility, (3) contact graphs and quadtree filtering help screen out poor configurations early, and (4) symmetry breaking reduces redundancy. Grouping these insights leads to key research directions in candidate initialization, rigorous geometric computation with analytic gradient exploitation, iterative local optimization with adaptive corrections, and formal verification using interval arithmetic.

A conceptual framework emerges in which initialization (via Sobol and weighted Delaunay) feeds into power-diagram based partitioning, with subsequent SLSQP optimization augmented by adaptive perturbations and analytic gradient enforcement directly derived from the explicit formulas for circle non-overlap and boundary constraints. An additional verification layer leverages interval arithmetic (using libraries such as python-intervals, PyInterval, or PyInter) to rigorously validate that each candidate satisfies non-overlap and containment, thereby closing any potential gaps. This multi-layered framework minimizes risks of overfitting by ensuring diverse candidate generation and by applying symmetry-breaking constraints where necessary.

Based on these directions, we propose multiple algorithmic ideas:
1. Hybrid Weighted Delaunay with Power Diagram SLSQP and Interval Verification (Idea A).
2. Sobol-Quadtree and Contact Graph Filtered SLSQP (Idea B).
3. Adaptive Sobol Multi-Start with Interval-Corrected SLSQP and Symmetry Breaking (Idea C).
4. A MISOCP formulation for exact packings (Idea D).

Given the early research progress (30%), the best candidate is Idea A. It blends robust candidate seeding via weighted Delaunay triangulation (using the weightedDelaunay package) with power diagram computations to extract maximum inscribed circles. Subsequent SLSQP optimization—employing analytic gradients as derived for both non-overlap constraints and unit-square boundaries—ensures precise feasibility. A rigorous interval arithmetic verification layer (leveraging python-intervals or PyInterval) is then applied to confirm that all circles are exactly within the square and non-overlapping, with adaptive perturbations integrated as a fallback mechanism.

# Evaluation Scores

### Originality (Score: 8)

**Positive:** This idea fuses weighted Delaunay initialization with rigorous power diagram analysis and supplements SLSQP local search with an interval arithmetic verification layer, offering a novel synthesis that is clearly distinct from prior approaches.

**Negative:** It requires careful calibration among several interdependent modules (initialization, analytic gradient computation, interval verification, and adaptive perturbation) which may complicate convergence if not meticulously tuned.

### Future Potential (Score: 8)

**Positive:** The modular design allows each component (weighted initialization, SLSQP optimization, interval arithmetic verification) to be independently refined or replaced, paving the way for application to other nonconvex geometric packing problems and facilitating future enhancements.

**Negative:** Empirical parameter tuning across different circle counts (26–32) is needed to ensure robustness, meaning that further generalization might require additional research into automatic parameter adaptation.

### Code Difficulty (Score: 7)

**Positive:** The method leverages established Python libraries (numpy, scipy, Shapely, weightedDelaunay, and interval arithmetic packages), supported by clear modular building blocks that simplify debugging and iterative development.

**Negative:** Integrating exact geometric computations with analytic gradients, interval verification, and adaptive control mechanisms introduces moderate implementation complexity and demands careful testing of module interoperability.

# Motivation

Combining advanced initialization with rigorous geometric refinement overcomes local optima and feasibility challenges. The strategy builds on proven techniques—power diagrams, SLSQP with analytic gradient enforcement, and adaptive perturbations—while incorporating weighted Delaunay seeding (via the weightedDelaunay package) and a robust interval arithmetic verification layer. This integration minimizes risks of shortcut learning and overfitting by promoting candidate diversity and applying symmetry-breaking constraints when required.

# Implementation Notes

• Use a Sobol sequence to generate initial candidate centers and refine these using weighted Delaunay triangulation (recommended via the weightedDelaunay package) for improved spatial distribution, as standard Delaunay libraries do not support weights.
• Compute the power diagram via a 3D convex hull method; lift 2D points with weights and extract the lower faces to reconstruct the diagram. Clip cells to the unit square using Shapely functions.
• For each clipped cell, compute the Maximum Inscribed Circle (MIC) with high-precision methods and update circle centers and radii accordingly.
• Optimize the candidate configuration via SLSQP using explicit analytic gradients derived from the formulas for non-overlap ((x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 - (r_i + r_j)^2 >= 0) and boundary constraints (x_i - r_i >= 0, 1 - x_i - r_i >= 0, etc.).
• Leverage an interval arithmetic library (e.g. python-intervals, PyInterval, or PyInter) to create intervals for each circle's center and radius and rigorously verify non-overlap and containment. Use these interval checks to ascertain that every candidate configuration strictly satisfies geometric constraints.
• Optionally, impose symmetry-breaking constraints (such as ordering of radii or fixing one circle's position) to avoid redundant configurations.
• If verification fails, apply adaptive perturbations proportional to the severity of constraint violations and rerun the SLSQP optimization.
• Iterate over multiple restarts, logging and selecting the configuration with the maximum sum of radii.

# Pseudocode

# Evolution History

**Version 1:** A hybrid algorithm that integrates exact power diagram calculation with iterative refinement. The method starts by seeding circle centers, then computes an exact weighted Voronoi (power) diagram using the transformation of weighted points and 3D convex hull. It updates each circle's parameters by calculating the maximum inscribed circle within each power cell (using Shapely with precision settings) and refines the configuration using SLSQP with robust non-overlap constraints.

**Version 2:** Multi-Start Adaptive Power Diagram with SLSQP, Analytic Gradients, and Bisection Correction

**Version 3:** Adaptive Perturbation Enhanced Multi-Start Approach builds on the baseline power diagram method by integrating an adaptive perturbation mechanism to nudge infeasible candidates into validity prior to gradient-based SLSQP refinement. It emphasizes robust geometric processing using Shapely’s MIC and clipping functions to ensure each candidate power cell is correctly confined within the unit square.

**Version 4:** Hybrid Weighted Delaunay Enhanced Adaptive Multi-Start SLSQP with Interval Verification for exact circle packings.
