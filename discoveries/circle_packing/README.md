# Report for circle_packing

## Overview

SDP-Augmented Branch-and-Bound with Interval Geometric Filtering integrates an SDP relaxation stage (enhanced with RLT cuts) into the existing block-coordinate descent framework. It employs these relaxations to generate tight global bounds for the nonconvex circle packing constraints, and then embeds these bounds in a branch-and-bound algorithm that leverages interval arithmetic to rigorously prune infeasible or suboptimal regions. The method also incorporates dihedral symmetry reduction and prioritizes larger circles in the branching strategy.

# Deep Research Report

Below is a strengthened synthesis of our insights and the resulting research directions. Our starting algorithm – Interval-Certified Weighted Delaunay Block-Coordinate Descent with Advanced Branch-and-Bound Corrections – already blends multi-start Apollonian seeding, block-coordinate SLSQP for alternating position–radii updates, and rigorous interval verification. This approach benefits from weighted Delaunay filtering to limit candidate overlapping pairs and leverages adaptive Armijo damping and branch-and-bound (with simplex and SDP-based bounds) to refine near-violations towards an exact feasible configuration.

Insights from the starting point include: (1) the effectiveness of multi-start and Apollonian seeding in reliably initializing exactly n circles; (2) the utility of alternating SLSQP optimization phases for separately adjusting positions and radii under strict non-overlap and boundary conditions; and (3) the robustness provided by weighted Delaunay filtering along with interval certification. In addition, related work underlines the potential of exploiting square dihedral symmetry to reduce redundant variable dimensions and the use of Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) cuts to tighten SDP relaxations.

These insights have been grouped into three research directions: symmetry-enhanced initialization and reduction (leveraging dihedral group properties), SDP- and interval-based global validation integrated within a branch-and-bound framework, and advanced projection corrections (potentially enhanced by Minkowski sums and homotopy-based restart strategies) to avoid stagnation and shortcut learning. We have maintained consideration of alternative ideas, but the current SDP-Augmented Branch-and-Bound approach best balances global optimality certification with rigorous feasibility while mitigating overfitting through multi-start strategies and diversity in branching.

The proposed idea incorporates additional steps to address computational challenges inherent in embedding SDP solves. It recommends the inclusion of RLT cuts to further tighten the relaxation and the use of efficient SDP solvers that lessen memory and runtime burdens. The methodology also enforces dihedral symmetry reduction and prioritizes larger circles in the branch-and-bound decision process, thereby reducing redundant computations and avoiding overly specialized configurations that might lead to shortcut learning.

Overall, every step – from initialization, local SLSQP optimization, SDP relaxation with RLT enhancements, through to branch-and-bound with interval verification – is now described in sufficient detail to facilitate reproducibility while addressing known issues such as overfitting and computational intensity.

# Evaluation Scores

### Originality (Score: 9)

**Positive:** Integrating enhanced SDP relaxations (with RLT cuts) with a prioritized branch-and-bound strategy and symmetry exploitation is a novel combination that advances global and rigorous optimality in variable-radius circle packing.

**Negative:** The integration increases the algorithmic complexity, requiring careful calibration between SDP, branch-and-bound, and local projection steps, potentially leading to higher computational overhead.

### Future Potential (Score: 9)

**Positive:** This modular and robust framework can extend to other nonconvex geometric optimization problems, including higher-dimensional packings and similar QCQPs, sparking further innovations in hybrid global–local optimization methods.

**Negative:** The practical performance may require substantial empirical tuning and might be challenged by the computational costs, especially in SDP solving and memory utilization.

### Code Difficulty (Score: 8)

**Positive:** Leveraging established libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Shapely, and state-of-the-art SDP solvers) within a modular design eases incremental integration and testing, with clear stages for local and global optimization.

**Negative:** The need to interface SDP solvers, implement RLT cuts, and integrate a carefully tuned branch-and-bound with precise interval verification increases code complexity and debugging effort.

# Motivation

This approach addresses both global optimality and local feasibility: SDP relaxations provide convex approximations that yield tight upper bounds, while branch-and-bound systematically explores candidate configurations. The integration of interval arithmetic guarantees that exact non-overlap and boundary adherence are maintained. By incorporating symmetry reduction and RLT cuts, the method mitigates computational cost and reduces redundancy, making it well-suited for variable-radius packings with 26–32 circles without falling into overfitting or shortcut learning.

# Implementation Notes

1. Start with a multi-start initialization using Apollonian and grid-based seeding while enforcing dihedral symmetry to reduce redundant configurations. 2. Alternate SLSQP optimization to update positions (with fixed radii) and radii (with fixed positions). 3. At each iteration, solve an SDP relaxation (augmented with RLT cuts) to get a global bound on the objective. 4. Embed this bound in a branch-and-bound framework that uses interval arithmetic (e.g., via intvalpy) to verify feasibility and prune non-promising branches. 5. Prioritize branching decisions based on circle radii (processing larger circles first) and employ weighted Delaunay filtering along with adaptive Armijo damping for local projection corrections. 6. Periodically apply homotopy continuation-based restarts if stagnation is detected, ensuring diversity of search and avoiding shortcut learning.

# Pseudocode

```
for each initial_config in multi_start_pool:
    config = initialize(initial_config)  // enforce dihedral symmetry
    while not converged(config):
        config.positions = optimize_positions_SLSQP(config.radii)
        config.radii = optimize_radii_SLSQP(config.positions)
        global_bound = solve_SDP_relaxation(config)  // include RLT cuts
        if global_bound indicates potential violation or suboptimality:
             config = branch_and_bound_refinement(config, global_bound, interval_verify, prioritize_larger_circles)
        config = apply_weighted_Delaunay_filtering_and_damped_projection(config)
        if stagnation_detected(config):
             config = apply_homotopy_restart(config)
