    "description": "Contrastive Pretraining with Adaptive Dual Loss ViT+GPT2 builds on a frozen, contrastively pre-trained ViT encoder using domain-specific augmentations for robust feature extraction. A learnable projection with positional encoding aligns the features for a GPT-2 decoder that is fine-tuned with a dual loss comprising cross-entropy and GPU-accelerated soft edit distance loss. A dynamic lambda scheduler balances the losses, and grammar-constrained beam search guarantees syntactically valid InChI strings.",
    "motivation": "This idea leverages state-of-the-art contrastive pretraining and adaptive loss optimization to directly minimize the mean Levenshtein distance between generated and ground truth InChI strings. It combines robust image feature extraction with constrained sequence decoding, ensuring chemical validity while keeping the implementation feasible within a 30-minute budget on an A6K GPU.",
    "implementation_notes": "1. Start with a pretrained ViT encoder and fine-tune it using a contrastive loss (e.g., SimCLR or MoCo) on chemically augmented images (using RanDepict and AugLiChem). 2. Apply a learnable linear projection and add positional encodings to align the feature dimensions with the GPT-2 decoder. 3. Tokenize InChI strings with a custom AIS/BPE tokenizer that respects InChI delimiters and special tokens. 4. Decode using a GPT-2 model augmented with cross-attention layers. 5. Train with a composite loss: a standard cross-entropy loss plus GPU-accelerated soft edit distance loss (using pysdtw or pytorch-softdtw-cuda), ensuring that input sequences are padded to a uniform length. 6. Implement dynamic lambda scheduling using established methods (e.g., SoftAdapt or Auto-Lambda) to balance the loss components throughout training. 7. During inference, deploy a grammar-constrained beam search\u2014leveraging constrained decoding libraries\u2014to enforce syntactic rules derived from available InChI technical manuals and emerging EBNF specifications. Note that careful hyperparameter tuning is essential to avoid overfitting and ensure that the model does not rely on shortcut learning.",

  "report": "# Report: Contrastive Pretraining with Adaptive Dual Loss for InChI Generation\n\nOur approach builds on recent advances in vision-language models and domain-specific augmentations to improve InChI generation from molecular images. Key insights from the starting idea include the use of domain-specific chemical augmentations (e.g., RanDepict, AugLiChem) to preserve critical molecular features, and a dual loss training mechanism combining cross-entropy with a GPU-accelerated soft edit distance. The learnable feature projection with positional encoding ensures effective fusion of visual features into the language model, while grammar-constrained beam search\u2014implemented with tools such as transformers-CFG or constrained-decoding libraries\u2014guarantees chemically valid output based on the best available InChI technical documentation and emerging EBNF guidelines.\n\nRelated works emphasize the value of contrastive pretraining (as seen in retrieval augmentation studies) and highlight the importance of dynamic loss balancing in directly targeting the mean Levenshtein distance. Recent methods like BLIP/ChemMLLM demonstrate robust vision-language alignment, and studies incorporating formal grammar constraints underline improved syntactic correctness in chemical sequence generation, despite the absence of an official InChI grammar. These insights converge into several research directions: (1) robust visual feature extraction via contrastive pretraining, (2) adaptive dual loss optimization using GPU-accelerated soft-DTW, (3) integration of dynamic loss weighting methods (e.g., SoftAdapt or Auto-Lambda) to effectively balance cross-entropy and edit-distance losses, and (4) enforcing grammar constraints during decoding to mitigate shortcut learning and overfitting.\n\nThe proposed framework decomposes the pipeline into two core modules. The first extracts image features using a pretrained ViT encoder fine-tuned with a contrastive objective on chemically augmented images. A learnable linear projection with positional encodings aligns these features with the GPT-2 decoder. The second module decodes InChI strings using a GPT-2 decoder augmented with cross-attention, trained with a composite loss that combines cross-entropy and GPU-accelerated soft edit distance loss. Dynamic lambda scheduling\u2014implemented via established techniques\u2014adjusts the loss balance, while grammar-constrained beam search ensures the syntactic validity of outputs based on evolving InChI grammar standards and technical guidelines.\n\nAdditional considerations: For GPU-accelerated soft-DTW, implementations such as pysdtw or pytorch-softdtw-cuda should be evaluated to ensure compatibility with batch requirements (e.g., uniform sequence lengths). Robust chemical-specific augmentations help prevent overfitting and shortcut learning, and comprehensive hyperparameter tuning is essential given the integration complexity. These reflections confirm that while alternative ideas (including retrieval augmentation) were considered, the current approach offers a balanced blend of innovation and feasibility with our available resources.\n",
